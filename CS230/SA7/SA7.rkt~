;; For this, the order of growth depends on the deepest that lists are within lists.
;; Therefore, the order of growth is O(N^x) where x is the deepest level of lists.
;; If there is only 2 levels of lists, like '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6) (7 8)), then it takes O(N^2) time
;; as it would through the first level of lists and then the second level of lists for each first
;; level of lists, similar to a nested for loop.
